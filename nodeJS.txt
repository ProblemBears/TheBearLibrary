IMPROVED DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW & DEBUGGING:
	-Understanding NPM Scripts:			-Process:		1) npm init
										2) Go to package.json
										3) Insert a key/value in "scripts"
										4) Finally, you can do "npm run <key>" where the key is the name of your script
										   you specified in "scripts"

							-Notes:			* Creating a "start" script is an exception where you don't have to use "run"
										  so you could simply do "npm start"

							-Notes:			* They key/values should not have whitespace
										* You should wrap in double quotes

	-Installing 3rd Party Packages:			-Process:		1) Go to the root of your App
										2) $ npm install <package>
											Ex1) $ npm install nodemon --save-dev 	//since this is needed for easy save/restart during development
							
							-Notes:			* Flags: --save 	: to install as a production dependency
											 --save-dev	: to install for development	(Creates devDependncies in your package.json)
											 -g 		: install to your machine

	-Using Nodemon for Autorestarts:		-Why:			* We would have to stop/rerun our server code manually otherwise

							-Process:		1) Create a "start" script with the value "nodemon app.js"
										2) Use "npm start" to run that script, which runs nodemon
										3) Now when we save a project, the server automatically reruns

							-Notes:			* You can not use nodemon in terminal if you install it as a local dependency. You would have to install it as
										  a global dependency to use it in terminal
