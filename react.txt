What is React.js?
	-A JavaScript library for building UI (client-side JS library)
	-Extra functionality can be added via community packages. For things other than UI (e.g: routing)
	-Competitors: *Angular - component based UI; uses TypeScript; has more features; overkill for small projects
		      *Vue.js - less popular than React & Angular
	-Course Outline: (Divided to these three categories)
		*Basics & Foundations:
			**Components & Building UI
			**Working w/ Events & Data: "props" and "state"
			**Styling React Apps & Components
			**Intro into "React Hooks"
		*Advanced Concepts:
			**Side Effects, "Refs" & More React Hooks
			**React's Context API & Redux
			**Forms, Http Requests & "Custom Hooks"
			**Routing, Deployment, NextJS, & More
		*Summaries and Refreshers

3 - REACT BASICS & WORKING WITH COMPONENTS
	-Creating a new React Project				*cd into a directory where you want to create the project folder
	 (with dummy code):					*Do:	$ npx create-react-app some-directory-name	//Then cd into it and do $npm start

4 - A (PRETTY DEEP DIVE) INTRODUCTION TO Next.js
	-Creating a New Next.js				-How:		1) Have NPM installed
	 Project & App:							2) Go to a directory where you want to spawn a new project directory
									3) To auto create:	$ npx create-next-app@latest
									4) It prompts you to name the directory

	-Adding First Pages:				-Prereq:	* Delete the following:
										** /pages/api directory
										** /styles/Home.module.css
										** /pages/index.js	//We delete this to show Next.js Routing

							-What/How:	* Next.js reads the pages directory structure to define routes:
										Ex: We put the following files in '/pages' and they have routes:
											** index.js = domain.com/
											** news.js = domain.com/news

									* Then, we can render the page by exporting A React component like usual (index.html):
										function HomePage() {
											return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
										}
										export default HomePage;

							-Important:	* YOU CAN OMIT 'react' imports in Next.js
									* The code is pre rendered so HTML code is sent giving us the advantage of no initial loading
