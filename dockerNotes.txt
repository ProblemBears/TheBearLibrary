DOCKER IMAGES & CONTAINERS: THE CORE BUILDING BLOCKS
	-Images and Containers:				* Images are the blueprints for containers, the contain the code + required tools/runtimes
	 What and Why?					* Containers are the running "unit of software"
							* So IMAGES are used to create MULTIPLE CONTAINERS

	-Using and Running External			* We can Find images
	 (Pre-Built) Images:					** Coworkers hand it to us
								** DockerHub - Where we can search community images
									*** EX: 	- We can run NodeJS's image via a container by using the command:
											  " docker run node " (anywhere in terminal) which runs a container
											  and pulls the image if not already locally installed.

											- The program is running but since containers isolate it inside, we
											  can't see it. To verify then, we do "docker ps -a" to see all processes

											- "docker run -it node" to actually INTERACT with the container's process
